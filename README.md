# 2003 NBA ReDraft Analysis

This project contains SQL scripts to analyze and redraft the 2003 NBA Draft, which featured future Hall of Famers like LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Carmelo Anthony. The analysis uses statistical metrics to determine how players should have been drafted based on their career performance.

## Project Overview

The 2003 NBA Draft is considered one of the best draft classes in NBA history. This project revisits the draft order by analyzing player statistics and performance metrics to create a data-driven redraft.

## Features

- **Statistical Analysis**: Evaluates players based on various performance metrics including points, rebounds, assists, and advanced statistics.
- **Impact Score Calculation**: Uses a custom formula to calculate each player's overall impact and value.
- **Redraft Simulation**: Reorders the 2003 NBA Draft based on players' actual career performances.
- **Position Change Analysis**: Shows how far players moved up or down from their original draft positions.

## SQL Scripts

- `2003 NBA ReDraft.sql`: The main SQL script containing the redraft analysis
- `2003 NBA Draft.csv`: The source data file containing player statistics
